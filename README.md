# fdf
Graphic programming project, FdF proposes to represent the mesh in "wire of a field" in 3D.

In this project you will discover the basics of graphic programming, and in particular how to place points in space, 
how to join them with segments and most importantly how to observe the scene from a particular viewpoint. 
You will also discover your first graphic library: miniLibX. This library was developed internally and includes 
the minimum necessary to open a window, light a pixel and deal with events linked to this window: keyboard and mouse.
This project introduces you to “events” programming.


FUNCTIONALITY

Press key events

x - draw lines

d - dots

i - isometric projection 

p - parallel projection

r - reset

c - colorize

key_left - move left

key_right - move right

key_up - move up

key_down - move down

numpad_plus - increase altitude

numpad_minus - decrease altitude


e.g.

./fdf ./test_maps/mars.fdf

./fdf ./test_maps/42.fdf

./fdf ./test_maps/pyramide.fdf

./fdf ./test_maps/100-6.fdf

./fdf ./test_maps/julia.fdf

P.S. At the moment compiles only on MacOs
